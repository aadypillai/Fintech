							<p>The payments committee as part of Financial Technology at Berkeley will focus on an area of fintech that is very popular as of now: payments platforms. Companies in this area are popping up everyday with many of them becoming household names.  Companies such as Stripe, Plaid, Affirm and more dedicate a lot of time and resources to maximize the utility of payments platforms on the internet and in everyday business utility, and as such, a knowledge in this area is not only valuable but essential for the future.</p>
							
							<p>The payments committee will focus on helping members gain a deeper understanding of what types of technologies and API fall under the category of payments. Along the way, the members will be able to implement the technology themselves in a web or mobile application while learning a lot more about this sector of the industry from professionals in the area while hopefully having time to explore more of the field through research of their own.</p>
